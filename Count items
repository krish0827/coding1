You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
Return the number of items that match the given rule.

class Solution:
    def countMatches(self, items: List[List[str]], ruleKey: str, ruleValue: str) -> int:
        a=0
        for i in items:
            if ruleKey=='type':
                if i[0]==ruleValue:
                    a+=1
            elif ruleKey=='color':
                if i[1]==ruleValue:
                    a+=1
            elif ruleKey=='name':
                if i[2]==ruleValue:
                    a+=1
        return a
